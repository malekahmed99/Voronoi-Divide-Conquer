# Voronoi Diagram using Divide and Conquer

This project was developed as part of the Geometry course requirements. It applies the Divide and Conquer approach to construct the Voronoi Diagram and analyzes how the algorithm works in terms of implementation, conceptual understanding, and time complexity.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to generate a Voronoi Diagram using a Divide and Conquer algorithm.  
The approach follows these phases:
- Splitting the set of points into smaller subsets
- Constructing partial diagrams
- Merging diagrams efficiently
- Ensuring correctness of boundaries and bisectors

## 👥 Team Structure
The project requirements divide the class into three specialized teams:

### **1. Implementation Team**
Responsible for writing the full working code and ensuring the algorithm produces accurate Voronoi partitions.

### **2. Explanation Team**
Creates a presentation explaining how the algorithm and the implemented code work step-by-step.

### **3. Time Complexity Team**
Analyzes the algorithm’s performance and explains the computational complexity.
